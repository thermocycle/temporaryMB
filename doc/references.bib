  title = {Analysis of Flow Maldistribution in Fin-and-tube Evaporators for
	Residential Air-conditioning Systems},
  school = {Technical University of Denmark},
  year = {2011},
  type = {PhD thesis},
  abstract = {This thesis is concerned with the effects of flow maldistribution
	in fin-and-tube A-coil evaporators for residential air-conditioning
	and compensation potentials with regards to system performance. The
	goal is to create a better understand- ing of flow maldistribution
	and the involved physical phenomenons. Moreover, the study investigates
	the individual and combined effects of non-uniform inlet liquid/vapor
	distribution, different feeder tube bending and non-uniform air-
	flow. In addition, the possible compensation of these maldistribution
	sources is investigated by control of individual channel superheat
	by distributing individ- ual channel mass flow rate continuously
	(perfect control). The compensation method is compared to the use
	of a larger evaporator in order to study their trade-off in augmenting
	system performance (cooling capacity and COP). The studies are performed
	by numerical modeling in the object-oriented pro- gramming language
	Modelica? and by using the commercial modeling envi- ronment Dymola
	7.4 (2010). The evaporator model needs to be capable of predicting
	the flow distribution and circuitry effects, and for these reasons
	the dynamic distributed one-dimensional mixture two-phase flow model
	is im- plemented. The model is verified in steady state with commercial
	software Coil-Designer (Jiang et al., 2006) and compared to steady
	state experiments with acceptable results considering the unknown
	degrees of flow maldistribu- tion for these experiments. Furthermore,
	the system dynamics in the model were validated and showed that a
	slip flow model need be used. A test case 8.8 kW residential air-conditioning
	system with R410A as refrig- erant is chosen as baseline for the
	numerical investigations, and the simula- tions are performed at
	standard rating conditions from ANSI/AHRI Standard 210/240 (2008).
	The investigations are performed on a simplified evaporator tube
	circuitry (two straight channels), a face split evaporator circuitry
	and an interlaced evaporator circuitry. The first case is a generic
	study and serves to provide general results independent of specific
	type of tube circuitry. The second and third cases are standard tube
	circuitry designs and these results are thus tube circuitry specific.
	In addition, a novel method of compensating flow maldistribution
	is analyzed, i.e. the discontinuous liquid injection princi- ple.
	The method is based upon the recently developed EcoFlowTM valve by
	Danfoss A/S, and controls the individual channel superheat by distributing
	individual mass flow rate discontinuously (on/off injection). The
	results in this thesis show that flow maldistribution decreases system
	per- formance in terms of cooling capacity and COP, but may be compensated
	sig- nificantly by control of individual channel superheat. The generic
	study (two straight channels) shows that the airflow maldistribution
	has the largest effect, whereas the liquid/vapor maldistribution
	has smaller effect and the different feeder tube bending has a minor
	effect on system performance. The compa- rison between the face split
	and interlaced circuitry shows that the face split evaporator performs
	better at uniform flow conditions, whereas the interlaced evaporator
	performs better at flow maldistribution conditions. When compen-
	sating, the face split evaporator always performs best. A similar
	result is also obtained as the airflow profile across the A-coil
	evaporator was predicted by means of CFD simulation software STAR-CD
	3.26 (2005) and applied in the numerical model. The main reason for
	the better face split evaporator perfor- mance at uniform conditions
	or when compensating, is that the superheated "weak" zones with low
	UA-value is located in the first tube row, where the heat transfer
	driving potential (temperature difference) is highest. The discontinuous
	liquid injection principle showed that the cycle time is an important
	parameter for the performance of this compensation method. The cycle
	time is essentially the time it takes for distributing mass flow
	to each evaporator channels. It should be kept as low as possible.
	Furthermore, it is better to use a partial secondary flow into the
	remaining channels while distributing the main flow to each individual
	channel. The discontinuous liquid injection simulations showed spurious
	fluctuations in pressure, which have not been observed as high in
	any experiments carried out at Danfoss with high enough sampling
	frequency. It is believed that the absence of the interfacial dynamics
	in the mixture model and the use of correlations developed from steady
	state experiments may be the reasons for these fluctuations.},
