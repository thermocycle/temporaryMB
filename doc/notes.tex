\abstract{The authors present a new moving boundary model that was integrated into the ThermoCycle package written in the Modelica language. Focussing on a seamless integration with existing components, this new component allows to calculate dynamic heat transfer in an efficient and robust way covering the full range of possible operating points in the liquid, two-phase, gas and supercritical domain. A basic validation performed with heat transfer data from two different experiments with evaporators shows that the model is able to reliably predict heat exchanger performance. The flexible implementation allows to compare different heat transfer correlations, which are made freely available as part of the ThermoCycle library. }

\section{Introduction and Motivation}

\Gls{MB} models are established tools to calculate heat exchanger performance in both steady-state and dynamic operation. A fictitious heat transfer channel is split up into different sections and with each section accounting for a different fluid state. In the case of an evaporator the maximum number of sections~\gls{N} is 3 for a)~subcooled, b)~two-phase and c)~superheated state. At higher pressures, the fluid might enter the supercritical state. Hence, there are four different sections out of which a maximum of three can occur simultaneously. The name \glsdesc{MB} is derived from the fact that the interfaces between these sections do not have a fixed spatial position but merely a fixed thermodynamic location depending on the presence of liquid and gaseous fluid, respectively. The actual existence of a certain section and its length are determined based on the fluid state resulting in variable sectioning. A fixed total length superimposes the required boundary condition to calculate the length of each section. 

\Glsdesc{MB} formulations are a good compromise between computational efficiency, robustness and accuracy\cite{Bendapudi2008}. 



\section{Formulation}
In the following sections the moving boundary model is described. In section \ref{sec: Assumptions} the mathematical formulation of the general governing equations describing the fluid flow through a control volume are reported together with the main assumptions adopted for the moving boundary model. Section \ref{sec: OnePhase} and \ref{sec: TwoPhase} report the derivation process for the governing equations for the one phase and the two phase regions respectively. Section \ref{sec: MetalWall} deals with the wall energy balance. In section \ref{sec: SeconadryFluid} the way in which the heat exchanger secondary fluid side is modelled.

\subsection{Governing equations and assumptions}
\label{sec: Assumptions}
The fluid flow through a control volume of the heat exchanger is described with a mathematical formulation of the conservation laws of physics:
\begin{itemize}
\item The mass of the fluid is conserved.
\item The rate of change in momentum equals the sum of the forces on a fluid particles (2nd law of Newton).
\item The rate of change of energy is equal to the sum of the rate of thermal energy addition to and the rate of work done on a fluid particle (Ist law of thermodynamics).
\end{itemize}
The fluid is considered as a continuum. The analysis of the fluid trend is carried out at macroscopic scale length (from 1 \si{\micro m} and larger). As a consequence the fluid molecular structure and motion can be ignored. The evolution of the fluid is described in terms of macroscopic properties i.e. pressure, temperature, density and velocity and their space and time derivatives. The general form of mass energy and momentum balance are reported here under:
 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:GenMass}
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + div(\rho \textbf{u})= 0
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
\label{eq:GenEnergy}
\rho \frac{DE}{Dt} = - div(rho\textbf{u}) + div(k grad T) + S_E
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:GenMomentum}
General momentum balance
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Moving boundary model equations}
\label{subsub: MBequations}
In order to derive a low-order model to describe the behaviour of the fluid flowing through an heat exchanger using the moving boundary formulations, the following assumptions are considered:
\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\theenumi}{\roman{enumi}}
\item The Heat exchanger is considered as n 1-dimentional tubes (z-direction) through which the working fluid flows.
\item The tube is cylindrical with a constant cross sectional area.
\item The velocity of the fluid is uniform on the cross sectional area. Homogeneous two-phase flow.
\item Kinetic energy, gravitational forces and viscous stresses are neglected.
\item No work is done on or generated by the control volume.
\item The enthalpy of the fluid is linear in each region of the tube (sub-cooled, two-phase, super-heated)
\item A static momentum balance is considered.
\item Pressure drop through the tube are neglected. Constant pressure.
\item The rate of thermal energy addition due to heat conduction is neglected.
\item the rate of thermal energy addition due to heat convection is considered.
\item Thermal energy accumulation is considered for the metal wall of the tube.
\item Thermal energy conduction in the metal wall is neglected.
\item The secondary fluid is treated as a constant heat capacity fluid.
\end{enumerate}

These assumptions allow to reformulate the conservation equations expressed in equations \ref{eq:GenMass} to \ref{eq:GenMomentum} as:

\begin{equation}
A \cdot \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \gls{mdot}}{\partial z}= 0
\label{eq:MassBalance}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
A \cdot \frac{\partial(\rho \cdot h - p)}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial ( h \cdot \gls{mdot})}{\partial z} = \gls{Qdot}
\label{eq:EnergyBalance}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
p_{\gls{sub:a}} = p_{\gls{sub:b}}
\label{eq:MomentumBalance}
\end{equation}
where A is the cross sectional area of the heat exchanger tube.The derivation process is described in detailed in \cite{KevinDocument}.
In the developed model, the thermodynamic properties are calculated using Coolprop \cite{Bell2013}. The state variables selected are \gls{p} and \gls{hbar}. The convection heat transfer coefficients  on primary side ($\gls{U}_{\gls{sub:pf},\gls{sub:1}}$,$\gls{U}_{\gls{sub:pf},\gls{sub:2}}$,$\gls{U}_{\gls{sub:pf},\gls{sub:3}}$) and secondary side ($\gls{U}_{\gls{sub:sf},\gls{sub:1}}$,$\gls{U}_{\gls{sub:sf},\gls{sub:2}}$,$\gls{U}_{\gls{sub:sf},\gls{sub:3}}$) can be calculated, using appropriate heat transfer model, or imposed as constant\\

\subsection{One phase flow region}
\label{sec: OnePhase}


\subsubsection{Mass balance derivation process}
In order to get the mass balance for one zone of the moving boundary model, we need to integrate equation \ref{eq:MassBalance} over the length of the zone from \gls{sub:a} to {\gls{sub:b}}:

\begin{equation}
A \cdot \int_{\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:a}}}^{\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:b}}}  \frac{\partial  \rho }{\partial t} dz + \int_{\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:a}}}^{\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:b}}} \frac{\partial \gls{mdot}}{\partial z} dz= 0
\label{eq: MassBalInt}
\end{equation}

Applying Leibniz rule for the first term and solving the integral for the second term of equation \ref{eq: MassBalInt}, results:

\begin{equation}
A \cdot \left[  \frac{d}{dt} \cdot \int_{\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:a}}}^{\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:b}}} \rho dz - \rho_{\gls{sub:a}}\cdot \frac{d\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:a}}}{dt} + \rho_{\gls{sub:b}} \cdot \frac{d\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:b}}}{dt} \right] = \gls{mdot}_{\gls{sub:a}} - \gls{mdot}_{\gls{sub:b}}
\label{eq: MassAfterLeibniz}
\end{equation}

Solving the  first term of equation \ref{eq: MassAfterLeibniz} results in:
\begin{equation}
 \frac{d}{dt} \cdot \int_{\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:a}}}^{\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:b}}} \rho dz =  \frac{d}{dt} \cdot (\overline{\rho} \cdot \gls{ll}) = \overline{\rho} \cdot \frac{d\gls{ll}}{dt} + \gls{ll} \cdot \frac{d\overline{\rho}}{dt}
\label{eq: MassDerDens}
\end{equation}
The bar over the density indicates the mean value of the variable over the considered zone. Substituting equation \ref{eq: MassDerDens} in equation \ref{eq: MassAfterLeibniz} results in:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:FinalMassBalance}
A \cdot \left[  \overline{\rho} \cdot \frac{d\gls{ll}}{dt} + \gls{ll} \cdot \frac{d\overline{\rho}}{dt} - \rho_{\gls{sub:a}} \cdot \frac{d \gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:a}}}{d \gls{t}} + \rho_{\gls{sub:b}} \cdot \frac{d \gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:b}}}{d \gls{t}} \right] = \gls{mdot}_{\gls{sub:a}} -  \gls{mdot}_{\gls{sub:b}}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:FinalMassBalance} represents the mass balance for a one phase zone of the heat exchanger.\\ The enthalpy distribution in the zone is considered linear as specified in section \ref{subsub: MBequations}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:LinearEnth}
\gls{hbar} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (h_{\gls{sub:a}} + h_{\gls{sub:b}})
\end{equation}
% Depending on the zone $\rho_{\{aa,bb}}, \gls{ll}_{aa,bb}$ assumes different values summarized in table \ref{Table:Values}.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:DensOnePhase}
\frac{d \gls{rhobar}}{d \gls{t}} =  \frac{\partial \gls{rhobar}}{\partial p} \cdot \frac{d p}{d \gls{t}} + \frac{\partial \gls{rhobar}}{\partial \gls{hbar}}\cdot \frac{d \gls{hbar}}{d \gls{t}} = 
\frac{\partial \gls{rhobar}}{\partial p} \cdot \frac{d p}{d \gls{t}} +  \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\partial \gls{rhobar}}{\partial \gls{hbar}}  \cdot (\frac{d \gls{h}_{\gls{sub:a}}}{d \gls{t}} + \frac{d \gls{h}_{\gls{sub:b}}}{d \gls{t}})
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq: enthLimits}
\frac{d \gls{h}_{\gls{sub:b}}}{d \gls{t}} =  \frac{\partial \gls{h}_{\gls{sub:l}}}{\partial \gls{p}} \frac{d \gls{p}}{d \gls{t}}  \;\;\;\;\;\; , \;\;\; \frac{d \gls{h}_{\gls{sub:a}}}{d \gls{t}} =  \frac{\partial \gls{h}_{\gls{sub:v}}}{\partial \gls{p}} \frac{d \gls{p}}{d \gls{t}}
\end{equation}
in case of subcooled and superheated zone respectively.

% \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\partial \gls{rhobar}}{\partial \gls{hbar}} \cdot \frac{\partial \gls{h}}{\partial \gls{p}} \frac{d \gls{p}}{d \gls{t}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% ENERGY BALANCE DERIVATION PROCESS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Energy Balance: derivation process}
Equation \ref{eq:EnergyBalance} is integrated over the length to get the energy balance of one zone of the heat exchanger:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq: EnerBalOneZone}
A \cdot \int_{\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:a}}}^{\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:b}}} \frac{\partial(\rho \cdot h)}{\partial t} dz - A \cdot l \cdot \frac{dp}{dt} + \int_{\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:a}}}^{\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:b}}} \frac{\partial (h \cdot \gls{mdot})}{\partial z} dz =  \gls{Qdot}
\end{equation}

Applying Leibniz rule for the first integral term and solving the second integral term results in:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq: EnerBalOneZone_2}
A \cdot \left[ \frac{d}{dt} \int_{\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:a}}}^{\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:b}}} (\rho \cdot h) dz   +  (\rho_{\gls{sub:a}} h_{\gls{sub:a}}) \cdot \frac{dl_{\gls{sub:a}} }{dt} - (\rho_{\gls{sub:b}} h_{\gls{sub:b}}) \cdot \frac{dl_{\gls{sub:b}} }{dt} \right] - A \cdot l_{\gls{sub:a}} \cdot \frac{dp}{dt}= \gls{mdot}_{\gls{sub:a}} \cdot \gls{h}_{\gls{sub:a}} -  \gls{mdot}_{\gls{sub:b}} \cdot \gls{h}_{\gls{sub:b}} + \gls{Qdot}
\end{equation}

The rate of enthalpy change can be calculated using equation \ref{eq: EnthRate}. Applying the mean-value theorem to get rid of the integral and approximating $\overline{\rho h} = \overline{\rho}\overline{h}$ it results in:

\begin{equation}
 \frac{d}{dt} \int_{\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:a}}}^{\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:b}}} (\rho \cdot h) dz = \frac{d}{dt} ( \overline{\rho h} \cdot \gls{ll}) \approx  \frac{d}{dt} ( \overline{\rho} \cdot \overline{h} \cdot \gls{ll}) =  \overline{\rho} \overline{h} \frac{d  \gls{ll}}{dt} + \overline{h} \gls{ll} \frac{d  \overline{\rho}}{dt} + \overline{\rho} \gls{ll} \frac{d  \overline{h}}{dt}
\label{eq: EnthRate}
\end{equation}

Substituting equation \ref{eq: EnthRate} into equation \ref{eq: EnerBalOneZone_2} the energy balance for a one phase zone results in:

\begin{equation}
A \cdot \left[ \overline{\rho} \overline{h} \frac{d  \gls{ll}}{dt} + \overline{h} \gls{ll} \frac{d  \overline{\rho}}{dt} + \overline{\rho} \gls{ll} \frac{d  \overline{h}}{dt} +  (\rho_{\gls{sub:a}} h_{\gls{sub:a}}) \cdot \frac{dl_{\gls{sub:a}} }{dt} - (\rho_{\gls{sub:b}}  h_{\gls{sub:b}}) \cdot \frac{dl_{\gls{sub:b}} }{dt} \right] - A \cdot l_{\gls{sub:a}} \cdot \frac{dp}{dt}= \gls{mdot}_{\gls{sub:a}} \cdot \gls{h}_{\gls{sub:a}} -  \gls{mdot}_{\gls{sub:b}} \cdot \gls{h}_{\gls{sub:b}} + \gls{Qdot}
\end{equation}

which represents the energy balance for the first zone of the heat exchanger. The same procedure can be applied to develop the energy balance for the second and the third zone of the heat exchanger.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% TWO PHASE REGION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Two Phase region}
In this section the mass and energy balance for the two-phase zone are reported. A description of two-phase flow behaviour together with the definition of the primary variables characterising two-phase flow is reported in the appendix. 
\subsubsection{Mass balance}
Assuming homogeneous two-phase flow condition, the average density is calculated based on equation \ref{eq:rhoAveTwoPhase}: 

\begin{equation}
\overline{\rho} = (1-\overline{\gamma}) \rhop  + \overline{\gamma} \rhopp 
\label{eq:rhoAveTwoPhase}
\end{equation}

where $ \overline{\gamma} $ is the average void fraction.
Based on equation \ref{eq:rhoAveTwoPhase}, the rate of mass change for a two-phase flow becomes:

\begin{gather}
 \frac{d}{dt} \int_{\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:a}}}^{\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:b}}} \rho  dz = \frac{d}{dt} ( \overline{\rho} \cdot \gls{ll}) = \frac{d}{dt} ( \overline{\rho} \cdot \gls{ll})  \frac{d}{dt} (\gls{ll}\cdot ((1-\overline{\gamma}) \rhop  + \overline{\gamma} \rhopp )) =  \\
= \frac{d\gls{ll}}{dt} \cdot ((1-\overline{\gamma}) \rhop  + \overline{\gamma} \rhopp )) + ll \cdot (( \frac{d \overline{\gamma}}{dt}\rhopp +  \frac{d \rhopp}{dt}  \overline{\gamma} + \frac{d \rhop}{dt} - \overline{\gamma} \frac{d \rhop}{dt} - \rhop \frac{d \overline{\gamma}}{dt}) = \\
= \frac{d\gls{ll}}{dt} \cdot ((1-\overline{\gamma}) \rhop  + \overline{\gamma} \rhopp )) + ll \cdot ((\rhopp - \rhop) \frac{d \overline{\gamma}}{dt} + \overline{\gamma} \frac{d \rhopp}{dp}\frac{d p}{dt} + (1-\overline{\gamma})\frac{d \rhop}{dt}) 
\label{eq:MassFlowRateTwoPhase}
\end{gather}

Substituting equation \ref{eq:MassFlowRateTwoPhase} in equation \ref{eq: MassAfterLeibniz} the mass balance for a two-phase flow results in:

\begin{gather}
A \cdot [ \frac{d\gls{ll}}{dt} \cdot ((1-\overline{\gamma}) \rhop  + \overline{\gamma} \rhopp )) + ll \cdot ((\rhopp - \rhop)\frac{d \overline{\gamma}}{dt} + \overline{\gamma} \frac{d \rhopp}{dp}\frac{d p}{dt} + (1-\overline{\gamma})\frac{d \rhop}{dt}) - \\
- \rho_{\gls{sub:a}}\cdot \frac{d\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:a}}}{dt} + \rho_{\gls{sub:b}} \cdot \frac{d\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:b}}}{dt} ] =  \gls{mdot}_{\gls{sub:a}} - \gls{mdot}_{\gls{sub:b}}
\label{eq: MassBalanceTwoPhase}
\end{gather}
\subsubsection{Energy balance}
Considering equation \ref{eq:rhoAveTwoPhase}, the rate of energy change for a two-phase flow fluid results in:
\begin{gather}
\label{eq:RateEnergyTwoPhase}
\frac{d}{dt} \int_{\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:a}}}^{\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:b}}} (\rho \cdot h) dz = \frac{d}{dt} ( \overline{\rho h} \cdot \gls{ll}) \approx  \frac{d}{dt} ( \overline{\rho} \cdot \overline{h} \cdot \gls{ll}) = \frac{d}{dt} (\gls{ll} \cdot ((1- \overline{\gamma)}\rhop \hp + \overline{\gamma} \rhopp \hpp)) = \\
\frac{d\gls{ll}}{dt} \cdot ((1-\overline{\gamma}) \rhop \hp  + \overline{\gamma} \rhopp \hpp) + \gls{ll}\cdot(\rhopp \hpp \frac{ d\overline{\gamma}}{dt} + \overline{\gamma} \rhopp \frac{d\hpp}{dt} + \overline{\gamma} \hpp \frac{d\rhopp}{dt}+ \\ + \hp \frac{d \rhop}{dt} + \rhop \frac{d \hp}{dt} - \hp \rhop \frac{d\overline{\gamma}}{dt} - \overline{\gamma} \hp \frac{d \rhop}{dt} - \overline{\gamma} \rhop \frac{d \hp}{dt}) = \\
= \frac{d\gls{ll}}{dt} \cdot ((1-\overline{\gamma}) \rhop \hp  + \overline{\gamma} \rhopp \hpp) + \gls{ll}\cdot((\rhopp \hpp - \rhop \hp ) \frac{d \overline{\gamma}}{dt} + \overline{\gamma}\hpp \frac{\partial \rhopp}{\partial p}\frac{d p}{dt} + \overline{\gamma}\rhopp\frac{\partial \hpp }{dp}\frac{d p}{dt} + \\
+ (1-\overline{\gamma})\hp\frac{\partial \rhop}{dp}\frac{d p}{dt} + (1-\gamma)\rhop\frac{\partial \hp }{\partial p}\frac{d p}{dt})
\label{eq:EnergyRateTwoPhase}
\end{gather}

Substituting equation \ref{eq:EnergyRateTwoPhase}, in equation \ref{eq: EnerBalOneZone_2}, the two-phase flow energy balance results:

\begin{gather}
A \cdot [ \frac{d\gls{ll}}{dt} \cdot ((1-\overline{\gamma}) \rhop \hp  + \overline{\gamma} \rhopp \hpp) + \gls{ll}\cdot((\rhopp \hpp - \rhop \hp ) \frac{d \overline{\gamma}}{dt} + \overline{\gamma}\hpp \frac{\partial \rhopp}{\partial p}\frac{d p}{dt} + \overline{\gamma}\rhopp\frac{\partial \hpp }{dp}\frac{d p}{dt} + \\
+ (1-\overline{\gamma})\hp\frac{\partial \rhop}{dp}\frac{d p}{dt} + (1-\gamma)\rhop\frac{\partial hp }{\partial p}\frac{d p}{dt}) +  (\rho_{\gls{sub:a}} h_{\gls{sub:a}}) \cdot \frac{dl_{\gls{sub:a}} }{dt} - (\rho_{\gls{sub:b}}  h_{\gls{sub:b}}) \cdot \frac{dl_{\gls{sub:b}} }{dt} ] - A \cdot l_{\gls{sub:a}} \cdot \frac{dp}{dt}= \\
= \gls{mdot}_{\gls{sub:a}} \cdot \gls{h}_{\gls{sub:a}} -  \gls{mdot}_{\gls{sub:b}} \cdot \gls{h}_{\gls{sub:b}} + \gls{Qdot}
\label{eq:EnergyBalanceTwoPhase}
\end{gather}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% METAL WALL REGION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Metal wall}
\label{sec: MetalWall}
The energy accumulation in the metal wall can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\gls{sub:w}} c_{\gls{sub:w}} A_{\gls{sub:w}} \frac{\partial T_{\gls{sub:w}}}{\partial t} =\gls{Qdot}_{\gls{sub:pf}} - \gls{Qdot}_{\gls{sub:sf}}
\end{equation} 

Integrating over the length of one zone it results:

\begin{equation}
\rho_{\gls{sub:w}} c_{\gls{sub:w}} A_{\gls{sub:w}} \int_{\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:a}}}^{\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:b}}} \frac{\partial T_{\gls{sub:w}}}{\partial t} dz = \gls{Qdot}_{\gls{sub:pf}} - \gls{Qdot}_{\gls{sub:sf}}
\end{equation}
Applying Leibinz rule:
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\gls{sub:w}} c_{\gls{sub:w}} A_{\gls{sub:w}} [ \frac{d}{d t} \int_{\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:a}}}^{\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:b}}} \partial T_{\gls{sub:w}} dz  + T_{\gls{sub:w}}(\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:b}})\frac{d\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:b}}}{\partial t}- T_{\gls{sub:w}}(\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:a}}\frac{d\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:a}}}{\partial t}) ]= \gls{Qdot}_{\gls{sub:pf}} - \gls{Qdot}_{\gls{sub:sf}}
\end{equation}

Solving the integral the thermal energy balance for the metal wall is:

\begin{equation}
\rho_{\gls{sub:w}} c_{\gls{sub:w}} A_{\gls{sub:w}} [ \frac{d}{d t} \int_{\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:a}}}^{\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:b}}} \partial T_{\gls{sub:w}} dz  + T_{\gls{sub:w}}(\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:b}})\frac{d\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:b}}}{\partial t}- T_{\gls{sub:w}}(\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:a}}\frac{d\gls{ll}_{\gls{sub:a}}}{\partial t}) ]= \gls{Qdot}_{\gls{sub:pf}} - \gls{Qdot}_{\gls{sub:sf}}
